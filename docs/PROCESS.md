# Process

`uv sync` and `npm install` at the repo root install everything, including a git pre-commit hook. `npm run dev` starts the backend, the agent's service and the dashboard, passing them `.env`. `npm run seed` rebuilds the database `npm run dev` uses, on Supabase when `DATABASE_URL` is in `.env`. The agent always needs `DATABASE_URL`, where it saves its progress.

`npm run check` runs every check:

- Python: ruff (lint and format), pyright, and pytest with 80% coverage
- TypeScript: ESLint, Prettier, tsc, and vitest with 80% coverage
- Playwright end-to-end tests

The checks need no network and never read `.env`: the tests use SQLite, a stub model, signed-in handlers with a key of the tests' own, and stand-ins for Langfuse, the agent's service, Supabase Auth and the judge. Tables and connections on Supabase can be checked through the Supabase MCP server, which is read-only.

The pre-commit hook runs the format, lint, type and unit test checks on every commit.

## Planning

When asked to plan, as in "Please plan the pilot", write the plan to `docs/PLAN.md` and write no code.

- Start with the design: the modules, what each one is for, and how they depend on each other. Check it against `docs/CODE_STANDARDS.md` before you write the phases. Describe the agent's instructions by their goals, never as a list of steps.
- Split the work into phases, usually 5 or 6, each building on the last.
- Give each phase detailed success criteria that you can verify yourself: tests that pass, commands and their output, API calls and their responses, and pages you check in the browser with the Playwright MCP server. Write each one as a checkbox.
- Then stop and wait until you are asked to implement the plan.

## Implementing

When asked to implement the plan, as in "Please implement the plan for the pilot", build every phase in order without stopping. For each phase:

1. Build it, with tests.
2. Check every success criterion and fix whatever fails.
3. Review the phase's changes, as described below, and fix what the review finds.
4. Tick off its criteria in `docs/PLAN.md` and update `docs/STATUS.md`.
5. Commit. The pre-commit hook runs the checks; if it fails, fix the problem and commit again.

When the last phase is done, review the whole branch against `main` in the same way and fix what the review finds. Then run `npm run check` and report the results, including what the reviews found and what you changed.

## Reviewing

The checks show that the code works, but not that it is fit to merge. Every code change gets a review before it is committed.

- The reviewer is a fresh subagent that didn't write the code. Give it `docs/CODE_STANDARDS.md` and the diff, and ask it to review as a strict senior engineer deciding whether to merge the PR.
- It checks every standard, in particular: one way to call each service, with each URL written once; modules that keep to their own job and don't borrow each other's helpers; the framework's own way of doing things over hand-rolled code; functions that do one job; and agent instructions written as goals.
- Fix everything it would block the PR for before you commit. If you disagree with a finding, say so in your report instead of skipping it quietly.

## Rules

- Add tests with each change. Tests never call a model; use a stub model.
- Before a live dispatch or round with the real model, reseed once with `npm run seed`. Evaluations work their own copies and need no reseed. Keep to the runs the plan asks for.
- Browser checks sign in as a handler with `HANDLER_PASSWORD` from `.env`.
- Outside a plan, commit each change once you have checked and reviewed it.
- Run `npm run check` before you hand work over.
- Never use `git commit --no-verify`.
- Never lower a threshold, turn off a rule or exclude a file to get a green run. If a rule looks wrong, stop and ask.
- Keep `docs/STATUS.md` up to date.
- Never push.
- Don't open `data/evals/` unless you're asked to.
- Everything must work on Windows: write `package.json` scripts as `uv run` commands or `.mjs` files.
